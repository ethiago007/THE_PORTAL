## Specs



## Setup

_Node needs to be installed for this project to work. If you do not have it, please go to [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)._

1. Download this repository by clicking the "Clone or Download" button
2. Navigate to the folder where it downloaded
3. Open the terminal window and type `npm install` to install the required dependencies
4. This project uses Giphy API, so you need to acquire an API Key by making an account [here](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide). Click on "Create an app" to get started.
5. Once you obtain the API key from Giphy you will need to create a file named `.env` file in the root directory. \*\*\*
6. In the `.env` you will need to save your API key, as follows: `API_KEY: {Your-API-KEY-here}`
7. To start a live server of the project in your browser, run this command in your terminal: `npm start`.

\*\*\* An `.env` file will keep your API Key secure. [Read more on keeping API keys secure.](https://medium.com/@soni.dumitru/keeping-your-api-keys-secret-with-dotenv-b66aa05fdf71)
